page_title: 'Test Your Counting Skills'
intro_text: 'Here, you will have an opportunity to test and hone your ability to accurately and consistently estimate numbers of birds in flocks. You can choose an experience level and a range of flock sizes that are most appropriate for you, and you will be presented with sets of 10 images for which you will estimate the number of birds. The application tracks your estimates versus actual counts and provides summary statistics for your performance, which you may print for your records if you wish to.'
