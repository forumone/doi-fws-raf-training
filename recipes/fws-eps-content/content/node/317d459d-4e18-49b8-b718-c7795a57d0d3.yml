Guide"></p><p><em>(Large Waterbird I.D. Guide, Courtesy of the International Crane Foundation)</em></p><p><strong>2. Plan to conduct your survey between October 21 - October 30. Choose either morning or evening to count cranes at their roost or foraging in fields.</strong> Cranes generally leave their roosts approximately 30 minutes after sunrise and return 30 minutes before sunset, therefore, you should plan to arrive shortly before these times. Cranes can often be found feeding in adjacent agricultural fields just after leaving or prior to returning to the roost. Sunrise/sunset tables for your specific location can be found on the internet. <strong>Please write down all requested information on the </strong><a href="/epsandhill/sites/default/files/2019-06/Crane%20Survey%20Data%20Form_0.pdf"><strong>data form</strong></a><strong> during your survey and transfer that information into the data portal on this website.</strong></p><p><strong>3. New to the survey or looking for a new survey location?</strong> Scout locations for staging sandhill cranes prior to the survey window indicated above. If you are looking for new location, you can refer to the survey map on this website to identify areas that were previously observed and expand a search outside these locations. You can also check birdwatcher forums, <a href="https://ebird.org/">eBird</a>, or inquire with farmers about cranes that may be present in your area. <strong>Secure permission from landowners</strong> if private property must be crossed during your survey.</p><p><strong>4. Use good bird watching etiquette.</strong> Cranes can often be seen at a considerable distance and counts should be conducted with minimal disturbance to birds. Cranes should be monitored with binoculars or spotting scopes. Do not approach birds.</p><p><strong>5. Please submit ALL observations. Remember, "zero cranes" is still important information!!</strong> If the survey location you selected has zero cranes, we ask that you still provide all the pertinent survey information and simply indicate ''0'' for number of cranes observed. This information allows scientists to determine the annual distribution of sandhill cranes (presence/absence) and provides insight about the level of effort of each annual Fall Survey.</p><p><strong>6. If you have any questions, please contact Rachael Pierce (Rachael_Pierce@fws.gov). Thank you!</strong></p>'
