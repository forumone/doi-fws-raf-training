Each species is shown in both flying and standing positions, compared against a 6-foot human silhouette for scale. &nbsp;<strong>Whooping Crane:</strong> Tallest bird shown, white body with black wingtips in flight. Adult has a red facial mask; juvenile is brown and white. Flies with neck straight. &nbsp;<strong>Sandhill Crane:</strong> Slightly shorter, brown or gray body, red crown, long legs, and also flies with neck straight. &nbsp;<strong>Wood Stork:</strong> White body with entire wing edge in black, slightly hunched in flight. &nbsp;<strong>White Pelican:</strong> Large white bird with black mid-wing and wingtips, long orange bill, and short legs. &nbsp;<strong>Swan:</strong> All-white with short legs, long neck, and white wings. Flies with neck extended. &nbsp;<strong>Heron and Egret:</strong> Long-legged waders, fly with neck bent. Herons are darker; egrets are white. &nbsp;<strong>Snow Goose:</strong> Smallest bird in the chart, white with black wingtips, short legs. Diagram includes labels for key visual markers and flight postures. Presented by the International Crane Foundation.</figcaption></figure><p><em>(Large Waterbird I.D. Guide, Courtesy of the International Crane Foundation)</em></p></li><li>Plan to conduct your survey between October 21 - October 30. Choose either morning or evening to count cranes at their roost or foraging in fields. Cranes generally leave their roosts approximately 30 minutes after sunrise and return 30 minutes before sunset, therefore, you should plan to arrive shortly before these times. Cranes can often be found feeding in adjacent agricultural fields just after leaving or prior to returning to the roost. Sunrise/sunset tables for your specific location can be found on the internet. <strong>Please write down all requested information on the </strong><a href="/sites/eps/files/Crane%20Survey%20Data%20Form_0.pdf"><strong>data form</strong></a><strong> during your survey and transfer that information into the data portal on this website.</strong></li><li>New to the survey or looking for a new survey location? Scout locations for staging sandhill cranes prior to the survey window indicated above. If you are looking for new location, you can refer to the survey map on this website to identify areas that were previously observed and expand a search outside these locations. You can also check birdwatcher forums, <a href="https://ebird.org/">eBird</a>, or inquire with farmers about cranes that may be present in your area. <strong>Secure permission from landowners</strong> if private property must be crossed during your survey.</li><li>Use good bird watching etiquette. Cranes can often be seen at a considerable distance and counts should be conducted with minimal disturbance to birds. Cranes should be monitored with binoculars or spotting scopes. Do not approach birds.</li><li>Please submit ALL observations. Remember, "zero cranes" is still important information!! If the survey location you selected has zero cranes, we ask that you still provide all the pertinent survey information and simply indicate ''0'' for number of cranes observed. This information allows scientists to determine the annual distribution of sandhill cranes (presence/absence) and provides insight about the level of effort of each annual Fall Survey.</li><li>If you have any questions, please contact Rachael Pierce (Rachael_Pierce@fws.gov). Thank you!</li></ol>'
