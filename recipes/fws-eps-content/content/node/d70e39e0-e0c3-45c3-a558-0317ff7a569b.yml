      value: '<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fall survey for Eastern Population Sandhill Crane was established in 1979. It is implemented by state and federal agencies and public volunteers from 8 states in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways as well as the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Sandhill Cranes are widely dispersed during the breeding and wintering seasons and are difficult to count. The optimal time to survey cranes is during the last week of October when the majority of Eastern Population cranes breeding in Canada migrate to traditional staging grounds in the Great Lake states (e.g. Jasper-Pulaski Fish and Wildlife Area, Medaryville, Indiana). Since the initial survey in 1979, crane numbers have increased to over 90,000 birds! This survey is used to inform managers of changes in Sandhill Crane distribution and population trends.</p><p>We are asking for your assistance!!
