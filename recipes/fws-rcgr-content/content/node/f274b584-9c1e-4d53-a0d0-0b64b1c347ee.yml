The information that you provide is required to obtain or retain a benefit; however, failure to provide all required information will negate the registration and make the landowner ineligible to lawfully destroy resident Canada goose nests and eggs under the depredation order.

OMB has approved this collection of information and assigned Control No. 1018-0146.</p><h2>ESTIMATED BURDEN STATEMENT</h2><p>Public reporting for this collection of information varies with the convenient availability of the requested information. The relevant burden for the Resident Canada Goose Nest and Egg Registration is 30 minutes for initial registration, 15 minutes to renew the registration, and 15 minutes for reporting. These burden estimates includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of the form to the Service Information Clearance Officer, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, 5275 Leesburg Pike, MS: PRB (JAO/3W), Falls Church, VA 22041-3803, or via email to <a href="mailto:Info_Coll@fws.gov">Info_Coll@fws.gov</a>.</p>'
