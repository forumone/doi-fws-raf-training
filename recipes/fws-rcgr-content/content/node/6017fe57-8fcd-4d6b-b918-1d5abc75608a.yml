The report information is used by the Service to monitor and assess resident Canada goose populations.</p><p>To report, go to <a href="https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR">https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR</a> or go to <a href="https://www.fws.gov/permits">www.fws.gov/permits</a> and click on “New: Resident Canada Goose Nest Egg Registration.” Log on to the system using your login ID and password. You will be taken to your User Profile to certify the information is still current. You will then be able to report your activity for the year. Please make sure you report the number of nests affected, not the number of individual eggs, and do not leave any fields blank or the system will consider your report incomplete.</p>'

There is no fee to register on-line and work under the depredation order.

These States will determine whether they will continue to permit landowners to destroy nests and eggs under the State’s Federal SPCG permit or require that landowners operate under the Service’s nest and egg depredation order. A list with State contact information is posted on the registration website.</li><li>Public and military airports may continue to take nests and eggs under either airport depredation permits or the airport control order (50 CFR 21.49).</li><li>Nests and eggs may be destroyed under the depredation order for resident Canada geese at agricultural facilities (50 CFR 21.51) and the public health depredation order (50 CFR 21.52) if the State has chosen to implement these depredation orders.</li></ol>'
