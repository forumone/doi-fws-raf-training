Click on the text and you will see more information.</p></div><div id="FAQ_5"><h3>How can I see more information?</h3><ol><li>If any text is underlined on the page, click on the text to see more information.</li><li>Go to View/Search/reports to see any data in database.</li></ol></div><div id="FAQ_6"><h3>What information is required?</h3><p>On all data entry screens, required information is displayed in Bold type.</p></div><div id="FAQ_7"><h3>What if my choice is not in the drop-down box?</h3><p>Call or email Nicole Adimey or Donna Szemer and they will add it to the list for you. You will then see the new item in the list. You may need to back out of your data entry screen and re-enter the data.</p></div><div id="FAQ_8"><h3>How is this system organized?</h3><p>First, there are three main functions in the system: Data Entry, View/Search/Reports and Administrative Functions. You may not see all functions depending on your security group.</p><p>The underlying information is organized by animal. Each manatee has a manatee record with basic information such as sex, dam, sire, and then event records, such as rescue, transfer, release, death. Additionally, a manatee also has records with ID, tag, and status information.</p></div><div id="FAQ_9"><h3>How can I get help?</h3><p>Contact Nicole Adimey, FWS, 904.731.3079 or <a href="mailto:nicole_adimey@fws.gov">nicole_adimey@FWS.gov</a>.</p></div><div id="FAQ_10"><h3>How can I report errors?</h3><p>If you find data on an animal that is incorrect, just send us the MLog or Manatee number, the wrong data and the correct data. Much of the data has been cleaned up since this data was extracted from the database, but we will check any data error that you note.</p><p>For all errors on the screens, we need 3 things:</p><ol><li>The full web address from the banner at the top of the page. Just highlight it and copy it into an email or a word document.</li><li>A short description of what you were doing, including the MLog of the animal that you were working on. MLog (or manatee number) is listed on almost every page.</li><li>A Print of the Screen. For most errors, you can copy the screen to a word document by following these steps:<ol type="a"><li>Hold down the shift key and press the PrintSCRN button (usually to the left of your F keys above your keyboard. You won''t see any change on your screen, but that will put a copy on your clipboard.</li><li>Then open the Paint function (usually under Accessories in the All Program menu) Paste the screen into Paint (Just click on Edit and then Paste).</li><li>Click on the dotted rectangle tool and then use your right mouse button to select the main part of the screen, excluding the picture at the top and menu at the side. Cut this section.</li><li>Paste into a Word document. If you cut part of the screen, you can reduce the size of the document by as much as a factor of 10 which will make it easier to email the picture.</li><li>Save the word Document.</li></ol></li><li>Email the web address, description and picture of screen to <a href="mailto:carolsr@swcp.com">Carol Sanders-Reed</a> and <a href="mailto:nadimey@fws.gov">Nicole Adimey</a>.</li></ol></div><div id="FAQ_11"><h3>How do I enter a rescue for an animal that has never been rescued before?</h3><p>Menu Options are listed in Italics:</p><p><em>Enter Manatee Data</em><br><em>Rescue</em></p><p>You will see the Search Manatee Information. You must enter some identifying information for this manatee to check that it is not in the database. If the animal had a Pit Tag prior to rescue, enter the Pit tag in the Tag ID box. Double check the entry. If the animal did not have a Pit Tag prior to rescue, enter the Animal ID or Manatee Name to make certain that no one else has input this animal''s rescue already.</p><p>If the animal is in the database, it will be listed in the box. Click on the radio button and then select Go. If the animal is not in the database, then select <em>Enter a new manatee</em>.</p></div><div id="FAQ_12"><h3>Weights and Lengths?</h3><p>Weights and lengths should be listed in whole numbers. Round to the nearest kg or cm.</p></div><div id="FAQ_13"><h3>Rules on names?</h3><p>Each animal in the new system will have only one name. The name must be one word. The name cannot contain any punctuation (No periods, or special characters) Names can contain apostrophe like "Lorelei''s calf".</p><p>The system will not allow you to use a name that is already in the system, nor will it allow names that are being used by MIPS or other systems. MIPS and other systems will update a list in our system with names they have used.</p></div><div id="FAQ_14"><h3>Latitude and Longitude</h3><p>Latitude and Longitude must be entered in decimal form, not degrees, minutes, and seconds. You can try to search for latitude and longitude at <a href="http://www.florida.co.uk/latlongfinder" target="_blank">www.florida.co.uk/latlongfinder</a>.</p><p>You can enter up to 6 decimal digits for maximum accuracy.</p><p>You can convert degrees, minutes, seconds here:<br><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html" target="_blank">http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html</a>.</p><p>Latitude must be between 0 and 90.<br>Longitude must be negative and between 0 and 180.</p></div><div id="FAQ_15"><h3>Can I enter data for all animals in a facility at once?</h3><p>Select Enter Manatee Data from the Captive Manatee System home screen. Then choose Current Captives by Facility under Database Search. On the next screen select a facility and click on Next. Choose an animal by clicking on the radio button next to the animal and select an Action (Rescue, Transfer, Status Update, etc.). Then click on GO to enter that data.</p></div><div id="FAQ_16"><h3>Hints for searching for an animal</h3><p>If a search for an animal does not produce the manatee of interest:</p><ol><li>Try entering only part of the name such as Ros, or part of the Animal ID such as SWFTm08, the system will find all animals that have ros anywhere in the name, so Rose, Rosie, and also Frosty are displayed or all animals that have SWFTm08 in their ID.</li><li>Try using the Search for a list of manatees under Advanced Search if you know the month and year of rescue.</li><li>If the animal is currently located in a facility, search by selecting Current Captives by Facility under Database Search.</li><li>Make sure that you enter only one criteria in Search for an Individual Manatee. The system will try to find an animal that has all the criteria you list, so if one is mis-typed, then it won''t match any animal.</li><li>Check that you are entering the Rescue Id from a previous rescue. The system will not have the new Rescue ID listed.</li><li>If you still can''t find the animal, try entering a different piece of information. If you can''t find the animal by name, try entering an ID or perhaps the Pit Tag number or go to Advanced Search.</li></ol></div><div id="FAQ_17"><h3>I was interrupted when I put in a rescue and now when I enter the Rescue ID it says the rescue is already in the system. What do I do?</h3><p>The system uses different records to collect the information from a rescue, and here you have entered some of the records, but not all. Choose Search for a Manatee under Database Search. Enter the Rescue Id and select the animal of interest. Select Rescue as Action and click on Go. On the Enter Rescue screen, do not enter the rescue ID. This information is already in the system and this field is optional. Go on to enter the rest of the information. If you still get a message that the rescue is already in the system, contact a System Administrator.</p></div><div id="FAQ_18"><h3>How do I change data that was already entered?</h3><p>Data can only be updated by a System Administrator. Contact the system administrator with the Mlog, Animal ID, and information about the change. They will change the record for you.</p></div><div id="FAQ_19"><h3>How do I move between items on the screen or select items in a drop-down box?</h3><p>You can use tab to move from one field to another. You can enter the first letter of an item in a drop-down box to move down the list. If you keep entering the first letter, it will step through all entries beginning with that letter in most boxes. You can use your arrow keys to select items in a drop down box.</p></div><div id="FAQ_20"><h3>How do I enter another animal id, a name, and entanglement, a conditioning record, or a tag?</h3><p>First, select Search for a Manatee under Database Search on the Enter Manatee Data menu. Then search for your animal of interest. Once you have a list of animals, click on the Mlog (it will be underlined) for the animal of interest. This will bring you to the Manatee Information screen. In the middle of the screen are buttons listing any information you can add for this animal. Some options may not display, such as you cannot add a rescue to a dead animal. Click on the information you want to add, such as Enter Animal ID and the data entry screen will be displayed.</p></div><div id="FAQ_21"><h3>Why can''t I enter a status record?</h3><p>Status Updates should be entered twice a year, before the April and September FWS meetings. Only one status update can be entered in each half of the year. If you get a message that you cannot enter a status update, go to the Manatee Information screen for this animal and click on the status tab. Check to see if a status record was already entered for this half of the year (1 = Jan - June and 2 = July - December). If the status information is entered, but is incorrect, contact your System Administrator with the corrections.</p></div></div></div>'
